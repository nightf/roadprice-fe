## ðŸ¤– Development

We suggest to develop locally backend & frontend, then when all jobs are done (99,9%) we can proceeed with deployment.

```sh
.env.local
.env.development
.env.production
```

## ðŸ“¦ REST API Intergration

For rest api integrattion we use Axios (https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) \
Or you can use graphql, your choice! \
We setuped an istance in axios inside the `/app/utils/api/api.js`, then it can be imported & used it in every file. \

## ðŸ’Š Libraries inside the box

Our dashboard uses the following libraries:

| Name             | Link                                    | Installed |
